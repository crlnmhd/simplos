TODOs:
* mutexes
* alternative scheduling
* check on tasks
* check stack overflows DONE
* sleep
* inter task message passing / communication?
* Dynamic memory allocation!
* OO-like struct collecting OS functions and attributes? Probably a good idea.

Other possible improvements:
Move context switches out of interupts.
+ Ticking within context switches.
+ Easier memory managment (use more of OS task and priviliges).
+ Allow unrelated interupts in CS.
- Overhead? Complexity?
* put as much of the context switch as possible outside interupts or allow ticking inside context switches.
