TODOs:
  * unique task pids
  * alternative scheduling
  * inter task message passing / communication?
  * clean up code 
  * FIX THE BUILD SCRIPT MESS!!!!



How simplos (hopefully works)

Interrupt driven

Simplos uses a timer interrupt to trigger a task switching ISR. The ISR will save the content call the scheduler
and then restore the content at the possibly changed SP location. 

Scheduler
For now, simplos just uses a cyclic scheduler until the other parts of the OS have matured.

## Ideas:

# Dynamic memory allocation
Though admittedly truly useless and more of a hinderance than a help in many circumstances it would be a cool
addition.

# More advanced scheduler.
A more advanced, probably priority bases scheduler would be cool! Perhaps combined with some other technique
to choose amongst those with the same priority?



IDEAS:

* RT scheduler as well as non-RT
* Assert macro / function.
* More functions?
